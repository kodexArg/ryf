This is a post apocalyptic world. The place is Argentina and its different cities and towns. The Argentinian world is divided between raiders and citizens, that are constantly battling. Citizens lives in walled cities under a dictatorial regimen. Technology is forbiden and only soldiers and the clerical staff can use it (so, in your example, a Hacker and a data analyst are possible options but one of the ocupations should be Nun). You'll be generating a lot of characters, please be creative with the bio, explaining how the characters survive, how they live, etcetera. Try again.
